# Situation

At this stage in its' life this repository is really just a prototype to try out some ideas for how to combine gaming with the commons and with the semantic web

Whilst other [semantic web gaming prototypes provide a virtual map](https://github.com/calummackervoy/SimPolis), in situation players can layer their characters and stories onto the world around them via a map interface (Leaflet), and co-ordinates

At this stage we only want geeks, that is people who are willing to get into it a bit in order to get some fun out of this game. Once you create a character don't be expecting a Pokemon GO interface or planned adventure. Instead expect to find things via QR codes at your local community centre, online and by deliving into the semantic data yourself or publishing a web server. But at this stage of this stage, expect to be more like a test subject to see if different mechanics are fun. We might even fake some of them to start with
